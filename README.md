# Business Intelligence Tool - Fixed Version

## Issues Found and Fixed

### Original Critical Issues:
1. **Incorrect File Structure** - API files were in root directory, not in `/api` folder (FIXED)
2. **Inappropriate Content** - Line 405 in `index.html` contained inappropriate text (FIXED)  
3. **Build Configuration** - Vercel build configuration issues (FIXED)

### Vercel Build Error Fix:
The "No Output Directory named 'public' found" error was caused by Vercel trying to build this as a Node.js project when it's actually a static site with serverless functions.

**Solution Applied:**
- Removed unnecessary `package.json` (static sites don't need it)
- Simplified `vercel.json` to minimal configuration: `{}`
- Vercel will now treat this as a static site with API functions

## Project Structure (Minimal & Working)

```
business-intelligence-tool/
├── index.html              # Landing page (static)
├── tool.html               # Business intelligence tool (static)
├── api/                    # Serverless functions
│   ├── search-places.js    # Google Places search endpoint
│   └── place-details.js    # Google Places details endpoint
├── vercel.json            # Minimal Vercel config: {}
├── .gitignore            # Git ignore rules
└── README.md             # This file
```

## How Vercel Will Deploy This:

1. **Static Files**: `index.html` and `tool.html` served directly
2. **API Endpoints**: 
   - `/api/search-places` → `api/search-places.js`
   - `/api/place-details` → `api/place-details.js`
3. **Environment Variables**: `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` loaded automatically

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Variable (Already Done)
In Vercel dashboard:
- `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` = your new Google API key

### 2. Deploy
```bash
# Push to GitHub
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Vercel build configuration"
git push

# Vercel will automatically rebuild
```

### 3. Expected Behavior
- Build should complete without errors
- Static files served from root
- API functions available at `/api/*`
- No "public directory" error

## What Changed to Fix Build Error

### Before (Problematic):
- Had `package.json` with build scripts
- Vercel tried to run `npm run build`
- Expected output in `public/` directory
- Failed because no build process needed

### After (Fixed):
- No `package.json` needed for static sites
- Minimal `vercel.json`: `{}`
- Vercel auto-detects static files
- API functions work automatically

## Testing After Deployment

1. Visit `https://your-app.vercel.app/` → Should show landing page
2. Visit `https://your-app.vercel.app/tool.html` → Should show tool
3. Try searching businesses → Should work with real data
4. Check browser console → Should see API calls to `/api/search-places`

## If Still Having Issues

### Check Vercel Function Logs:
```bash
vercel logs --follow
```

### Common Issues:
1. **API Key Not Set**: Check environment variables in Vercel dashboard
2. **API Limits Exceeded**: Check Google Cloud Console quotas
3. **CORS Errors**: API functions include CORS headers, should work
4. **Function Timeout**: Increased to 30s for search, 15s for details

## Security Notes
- New API key should be domain-restricted
- Environment variables secure in Vercel
- No sensitive data in frontend code

The build error should be resolved with this simplified configuration. Vercel will now properly handle the static files and serverless functions without trying to run unnecessary build processes.
