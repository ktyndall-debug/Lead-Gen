# Business Intelligence Tool - Fixed Version

## Issues Found and Fixed

### Critical Issues Preventing Vercel Deployment:

1. **Incorrect File Structure**
   - **Problem**: API files were in root directory, not in `/api` folder
   - **Fix**: Moved `search-places.js` and `place-details.js` to `/api/` folder

2. **Inappropriate Content**
   - **Problem**: Line 405 in `index.html` contained inappropriate text "Find Hidden COCK Opportunities"
   - **Fix**: Changed to "Find Hidden Revenue Opportunities"

3. **Environment Variable Configuration**
   - **Problem**: `vercel.json` referenced non-existent environment variable
   - **Fix**: Removed the `env` section from `vercel.json` (environment variables should be set in Vercel dashboard)

### Minor Issues Fixed:

4. **Missing Node.js Version**
   - Added engines specification in package.json for Node.js compatibility

## Correct Project Structure

├── index.html              # Landing page
├── tool.html               # Business intelligence tool
├── api/                    # Vercel serverless functions
│   ├── search-places.js    # Google Places search endpoint
│   └── place-details.js    # Google Places details endpoint
├── package.json            # Project configuration
├── vercel.json            # Vercel deployment settings
└── README.md              # Documentation
```

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Variable Setup (Critical)
In your Vercel dashboard, add:
- **Variable Name**: `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY`
- **Value**: Your Google Places API key
- **Environments**: Production, Preview, Development

### 2. Google Cloud Console Setup
1. Enable these APIs:
   - Places API
   - Geocoding API
2. **Important**: Regenerate your API key (the previous one was exposed in the code)
3. Set API restrictions if needed (recommended for security)

### 3. Deploy to Vercel
```bash
# Option 1: GitHub Integration (Recommended)
1. Push this fixed code to GitHub
2. Connect repository to Vercel
3. Deploy automatically

# Option 2: Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel
vercel --prod
```

## What Was Wrong

### File Structure Issue
Vercel serverless functions must be in the `/api` directory at the root level. Your original files were in the wrong location:

**Wrong**: 
- `search-places.js` (root)
- `place-details.js` (root)

**Correct**:
- `api/search-places.js`
- `api/place-details.js`

### Content Issue
The landing page had inappropriate content that would likely cause deployment issues or content policy violations.

### Configuration Issue
The `vercel.json` was trying to reference environment variables incorrectly. Environment variables should be set in the Vercel dashboard, not in the config file.

## Testing After Deployment

1. Visit your Vercel URL
2. Navigate to the tool page
3. Try searching for businesses (should work with real API key)
4. Check browser console for any errors

## Security Recommendations

1. **Regenerate API Key**: The previous key was exposed in your code
2. **Set API Restrictions**: Limit to your domain only
3. **Monitor Usage**: Set up billing alerts in Google Cloud Console

## Support

If you continue having issues after implementing these fixes:
1. Check Vercel deployment logs
2. Verify environment variable is set correctly
3. Test API endpoints directly in browser
4. Check Google Cloud Console quotas and billing

The main issue was the file structure - Vercel couldn't find your API functions because they weren't in the correct `/api` directory.
